## Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-11-05

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our services, including when you sign in with Instagram. By using our services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### Who we are

Ishout ("we", "us", "our"). If you have questions about this policy, contact us at: <sayyambutt312000@gmail.com>.

### What we collect

- **Account identifiers**: your Instagram user ID, username, and profile information that you explicitly grant us access to via Instagram Login (OAuth).
- **Basic profile details**: name, profile picture, and bio (if permitted by Instagram and approved by you during consent).
- **Contact details**: email address if provided by Instagram and within granted scopes.
- **Authentication data**: OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens required to keep you signed in.
- **Usage data**: app interactions, device and log data (IP address, timestamps) for security and analytics.

We only request the minimum scopes necessary to authenticate you and operate the relevant features. We do not collect your Instagram password.

### How we use your information

- **Authentication**: to sign you in and maintain your session.
- **Account management**: to personalize your experience and manage your account settings.
- **Security**: to detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, abuse, or security incidents.
- **Service improvement**: to analyze usage and improve performance and features.
- **Legal compliance**: to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and lawful requests.

We do not publish content to Instagram on your behalf without your explicit action or consent.

### Data sharing and disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with:

- **Service providers** who process data on our behalf under strict confidentiality and security obligations (e.g., hosting, analytics, error monitoring).
- **Legal authorities** when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.
- **Corporate transactions** such as mergers, acquisitions, or asset transfers, subject to continued protection of your data.

### Data retention

We retain your information only for as long as necessary to provide the service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. OAuth tokens are retained only as long as needed for authentication and are revoked or deleted when you disconnect your Instagram account or delete your account with us.

### Your choices and rights

- **Consent management**: you can revoke our access in your Instagram settings and/or in our app’s account settings.
- **Access, correction, deletion**: you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information by contacting us.
- **Objection and restriction**: where applicable, you may object to or request restriction of certain processing activities.

### Children’s privacy

Our services are not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### International data transfers

Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate protections are in place in accordance with applicable law.

### Third-party services (Instagram)

Your use of Instagram is subject to Instagram’s own terms and privacy policy. Permissions you grant during Instagram Login determine what information we can access. You can review and change these permissions in your Instagram account settings at any time.

### Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new “Last updated” date. Material changes may be communicated via the app or email.
